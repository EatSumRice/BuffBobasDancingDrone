Day 1 - 
Created a class that would store numerous different default dance moves such that if the user were to input nothing or select a few number of dance moves than expected, the code would resort to those moves. 

Day 2 - 
Created the actual dance moves using send_rc_control and several move commands. Needed a lot of trial and error to see how the move would look in real time and also how to optimize the run time 

Day 3 - 
Worked on finding relative times in between dance moves to calculate how to integrate it with the BPM of the song 

Day 4 -
Worked on creating a list within the dance moves class. After that I tried working on getting the run file to parse through the list such that if a user was to not select any dance move or select too few desired dances moves for songs BPM, it would randomly select one from the list. Was unable to get it to work today
