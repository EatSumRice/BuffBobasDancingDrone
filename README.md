Day 1 - 
Created a class that would store numerous different default dance moves such that if the user were to input nothing or select a few number of dance moves than expected, the code would resort to those moves. 

Day 2 - 
Created the actual dance moves using send_rc_control and several move commands. Needed a lot of trial and error to see how the move would look in real time and also how to optimize the run time 

Day 3 - 
Worked on finding relative times in between dance moves to calculate how to integrate it with the BPM of the song 

Day 4 -
